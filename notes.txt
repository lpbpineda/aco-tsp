# ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION
#   - aka swarm optimization
#   - about the behavior of social insects (those who live in a colony)
#   - stigmergy, shortest path, dijkstra
# 
# Steps:
# 1. Place ants at city #1
# 2. Find path for each ant
# 3. Update pheromone intensity
# 4. Repeat step 2 until stopping criteria

# For TSP:
# 1. Initialize parameters:
#    - num_ants: Number of ants
#    - num_iterations: Number of iterations
#    - evaporation_rate: Rate at which pheromone evaporates
#    - alpha: Pheromone influence parameter
#    - beta: Heuristic influence parameter
#    - Q: Pheromone deposit constant
#    - tau0: Initial pheromone level
#    - tau: Pheromone matrix
#    - distance_matrix: Matrix storing distances between cities

# 2. Initialize ants:
#    - Create empty solutions for each ant
#    - Randomly place each ant in a city

# 3. Repeat for num_iterations times:
#      a. Clear solutions of all ants

#      b. Construct ant solutions:
#         - For each ant:
#           i. Move the ant to the next city based on pheromone and heuristic information
#           ii. Update the solution by adding the selected city

#      c. Update pheromone trails:
#         - For each ant:
#           i. Calculate the total distance traveled in the solution
#           ii. Calculate the amount of pheromone to deposit: Q / total_distance
#           iii. Update the pheromone level between cities in the solution:
#                tau(i, j) = (1 - evaporation_rate) * tau(i, j) + deposit_amount

#      d. Evaporate pheromone trails:
#         - For each city pair (i, j):
#           tau(i, j) = (1 - evaporation_rate) * tau(i, j)

#      e. Check for best solution:
#         - Update the global best solution if a new best solution is found

# 4. Return the best solution found
